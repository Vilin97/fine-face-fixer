I'm working on a military display of my grandfather that will be given to my father. My grandpa passed away five years ago, so I know this will mean the world to my dad. This is the only photo left of his time in Vietnam. I scanned it, but it was incredibly yellow faded. I tried a little photo voodoo myself and it's better than before, but I don't think it came out well.

Could someone help me recolor it correctly? The photo will be small (maybe 4x6 or less) but I'd like to to look as good as possible out of respect for the rest of the display.

Any help is appreciated!!

I've done a few photo restorations myself in the past and feel that I am now getting fairly good at them. I'm currently trying to restore this picture of my Mom with my Grandad but I am struggling a little with it and any guidance you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

 [https://imgur.com/a/s8eLNlo](https://imgur.com/a/s8eLNlo) 

I've attached what I have done so far with the original. The photo is not particularly big and is very badly damaged, I have made a good start but there are a few areas I've been struggling with , they are as follows:

**Grandad**

The right side (our right)  of his upper lip leading to his nose (this is a big old swirly mess atm) he had a pencil moustache but I'm not sure it's obvious.

His Chin

The top of his ear leading to where his hair starts, having no ear to use from the opposite side im at a loss as to how to deal with this.

**Mom**

There's a slightly odd looking sudden change in shade below the eye on our right.

The same with her lip on the same side and her chin too.

Thats it really I think I can deal with the other bits its just those.

Looking forward to your responses.

My fraternity has a memorial for Brothers who served and passed in WWII. Unfortunately, someone broke into the house and stole the image. We did not have any scans of it, but I took a picture of it a while ago with an okay camera. I was hoping that someone could mess with it, and put it into a state where we could print it and frame it again. Also, just wondering if we do get a fixed image, what would be the best way to get it printed? 

As a college student, I can only pay up to \~$20 to get this in good shape, so I hope that will be enough...

I have this photo of my grandparent's wedding in the early 1970s. To the left you can see a man and woman (she's wearing a red or pink dress), and I'm wondering if there's any way to lighten that up or clear it up. I don't really know anything about photo restoration or photoshop, so I don't know if that's possible though. The man and woman are my great grandparents and I never met them, nor do I have any other photos of them. I know the man most likely can't be any better, but I'm hoping the woman could look a little better. Also, this is a scan of the photo and this is the best quality I could get. Thanks!

Hey guys, I was hoping to have the watercolor removed from this piece I made so I could hopefully have this embroidered.

I am aware the photo is a little small, and for that I apologize. 

I really just want the head part of the design, so it really doesn't matter how that happens. Whether that be the removal of the water color or the cutting out of just the black lines of the head, both entirely work for me.

I can shed more information on his story if anyone is curious.

But to my request.  We took a trip to England this last month to visit the memorial, and my mother is making a shadow box with his medals/photo's in it.  There are several photos we have taken at that time, but aren't sure if we can keep them as they are from my grandfathers photo albums.  So we're trying to make a copy to print, and I used my phone to take the best shots possible.  Issue is they need a little work, as you'll be able to see.    It's not the best way to get copies I know, but easiest for us.

TL;DR: Have several photographs from the 40's that we're trying to copy.  Took photo of them with my phone, need help editing them. 


*****


I labeled the photos 1a, 1b etc, just for several shots of the same photo in case needed.  Not looking for colorized, just touched up for detail and lighting perhaps.  Not too good with this sort of work, any suggestions welcome.  Not sure if I tagged correctly so apologies for that.

I lost my friend back in February and one of things we'd always do as kids was watch the Back to the Future trilogy at his house much to the annoyance of his parents I'm sure.
Back to the Future was one of his all time favourites and funnily enough he was born on October 21st. 


I feel like I am asking a lot here but it would be greatly appreciated. I plan on showing friends and family of his on his birthday this year.

Unfortunately the background of the original photo was unacceptable and I have been trying myself to replace it. However, without photoshop or proficient editing skills, I have been unable to accomplish the goal. I am looking to have the picture and background from the following link merged, and to have the outline of the picture smoothed out into the background if possible to make it look less superimposed.

Thank you!!

PS: open to additional edits if users think they can crop/shift/alter composition to make the photo look better. Please don’t airbrush or alter skin/face/clothing though, needs to be authentic.

Thanks again!
